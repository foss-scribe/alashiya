## Coinage

Coinage varies across Alashiya, with money typically concentrated in urban settlements with well-established market economies.

Individual city-states are responsible for minting their own coins, and there is much regional variation across the islands regarding the size, metal content, and value. Generally, however, the city-states have agreed upon the talent (equivalent to 57 pounds of silver) as the basis on which the currencies are minted and exchanged.

Most city-states mandate by law that merchants can only use locally minted currency, which has created a thriving market for moneychangers -- the regulation of which varies from city to city.

|         | Obol  | Drachma | Mina  | Talent  | Notes            |
| :------ | :---- | :------ | :---- | :------ | :--------------- |
| Obol    | 1     | 1/6     | 1/600 | 1/36000 | Copper coin      |
| Drachma | 6     | 1       | 1/100 | 1/6000  | Bronze coin      |
| Mina    | 600   | 100     | 1     | 1/600   | Silver coin      |
| Talent  | 36000 | 6000    | 600   | 1       | 57 lbs of silver |

The most circulated coins are the *obol* and *drachma*, with the *mina* used only by merchants, moneylenders and governments. The talent is rarely minted, and when done so is typically done as an ingot or trade bar.

### Wages and salaries
Wages are typically paid in drachma, calculated daily, and at the employer's discretion. For example, an unskilled labourer would be paid at the end of each day, while those on government payroll are usually paid by the month.

| Occupation         | Wage/day    |
| :----------------- | ----------- |
| Unskilled labourer | 1/2 drachma |
| Skilled worker     | 2 drachma   |
| Masters craftsman  | 6 drachma   |
| Physician          | 12 drachma  |


## Costs of living

Costs vary across Alashiya based on availability and scarcity, wages, taxes, and tariffs. Locally produced goods are the cheapest, with imported goods priced at a premium due to the expense of transport and local duties.

Most city-states attempt to regulate or subsidise the staples of life (bread, olive oil, and beer) to prevent civil unrest. Bread is typically produced in state-run bakeries. In good times, a loaf of bread (1 lb) sells for 1 obol across the archipelago.

### Commodities

Commodities are priced and sold by dry volume. At wholesale, goods are priced and transported by the *medimnos* (50 litres), and sold to consumers in more manageable *hekteus* (8 litres) jars. More valuable commodities, such as spices are priced and sold by the *xestēs* (0.5 litres).

| Item            | Unit       | Value   |
| :-------------- | :--------- | :------ |
| Wheat           | *medimnos* |         |
| Wheat           | *hekteus*  | 16 obol |
| Barley          | *medimnos* |         |
| Salt            | *hekteus*  |         |
| Cumin, refined  | *xestēs*   |         |
| Pepper, refined | *xestēs*   |         |
