Alashiya is the setting for [Chris Rosser's](https://chrisrosser.net) [*The Codex of Destiny*](https://chrisrosser.net/books/codex-of-destiny), and other stories. It's liberally inspired by many historical cultures and time periods, but notably the Ancient Aegean, Near East with a dash of India and China added for flavour. In summary, it's a sandpit where I can indulge my life-long passion for archaeology, history and martial arts.

## Open-source world-building

I've taken the unusual step to release Alashiya under a creative commons licence. World-building is hard and time-consuming, and in all honesty it's only a means to an end. Typically it's of secondary importance to the story you are writing or the TTRPG campaign you're running for your players.

I don't think world-building should be an impediment to a writer or game master's creativity and fun. So, if open-sourcing Alashiya helps others realise their creative vision, then you are free use and adapt this setting under the terms [outlined below](#copyright-and-license).

In the spirit of open-source and collaboration, I also welcome contributions. For information about contributing, see the readme on [Github](https://github.com/foss-scribe/alashiya/blob/master/README.md)
