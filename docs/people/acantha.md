> Acantha, Keeper of the Still Flame

Acantha, known variously as The Wandering Sage, Keeper of the Still Flame, and Founder of the Sixfold Path, was a monk and philosopher who exerted profound impact on Alashiyan society and religion during his life and beyond. A divisive and controversial figure, his teachings challenged the notion of the gods' divinity and the role of the temple priests and oracles as their intermediaries.

## Biography

### Early Life

Born in a modest village nestled in the foothills of an ancient mountain range, Acantha was the child of a stonemason and a midwife. From a young age, he exhibited a quiet wisdom that belied his years, often asking profound questions about suffering, purpose, and the nature of the self. Orphaned during a bandit raid at the age of 12, Acantha was taken in by a wandering monk named Terasos, who recognised the boy’s potential for greatness.

Under Terasos’s tutelage, Acantha began his education in philosophy, meditation, and rudimentary martial arts. His early hardships inspired him to seek a deeper understanding of how mankind could endure suffering and live virtuous lives despite the whims of the capricious Gods and the chaos of the world.


### The Pilgrimage of the Flame

At the age of 22, following Terasos’s death, Acantha set out on a decades-long journey across the known world and beyond. He travelled east beyond the borders of Alashiya to to distant lands, and learnt from sages, warriors, and mystics. His travels became known as the **Pilgrimage of the Flame**, symbolizing his quest to carry an inner fire of wisdom and discipline that would never waver.

During his journey, Acantha encountered:

- **The Flame Dancers of Zyros**: From whom he learned the art of controlling energy and breath through motion. 
- **The Silent Masters of Lunara**: Who taught him dream meditation and the importance of stillness in the mind.
- **The Iron Guardians of Tyradon**: Warriors who emphasized discipline, honour, and the integration of martial arts with ethical principles.

Through these experiences, Acantha refined his teachings over the years into a unique blend of philosophy, spiritual enlightenment, and physical discipline.  


### Philosophy

Acantha’s philosophy revolved around three central principles:  

1. **Stoic Resilience**: Embrace life’s challenges as opportunities for growth. Suffering is inevitable, but how we respond defines our character.
2. **Enlightened Stillness**: True enlightenment arises not from escape but from embracing the present moment with clarity and detachment.
3. **The Martial Path as Discipline**: Martial arts are not tools of violence but expressions of balance, control, and the harmony between body and mind.

He often used the metaphor of a **Still Flame**, a candle that burns steadily no matter how fierce the surrounding winds. This flame represented the inner peace and strength cultivated through discipline.


### Founding of the Sixfold Path

In his later years, Acantha established six monasteries throughout Alashiya, each focusing on a specific interpretation of his teachings. These monasteries became centers of martial and spiritual training, their philosophies influencing generations of warriors, monks, and scholars:  

1. **The Still Flame Monastery**: Dedicated to meditation and stoic philosophy, emphasizing mental clarity and detachment.
2. **The Azure Wind Monastery**: Focused on fluid martial arts forms inspired by the flow of air and water.
3. **The Iron Lotus Monastery**: Specialized in hard, defensive combat styles and the ethics of strength.
4. **The Crimson Sun Monastery**: Combined vigorous physical training with studies of enlightenment through motion.
5. **The Obsidian Mirror Monastery**: Explored the duality of light and shadow, teaching self-reflection and balance.
6. **The Verdant Path Monastery**: Celebrated harmony with nature, incorporating animal-inspired martial arts and ecological philosophy.


### Legacy

Acantha passed away peacefully at the age of 87 in the gardens of the Still Flame Monastery. His followers declared the day of his death a time of meditation and reflection, calling it the **Day of the Flame's Rest**.

His teachings continued to inspire, with each monastery interpreting his philosophy through its own lens. While debates often arose about the true path of Acantha’s teachings, they ultimately strengthened the traditions by fostering dialogue and growth.

Acantha's writings, compiled in the tome **The Sixfold Flame**, remain sacred texts studied by monks, philosophers, and martial artists. His influence shaped not only the spiritual practices of his time but also the martial traditions of entire regions, making him one of history’s most revered figures of wisdom and discipline.
